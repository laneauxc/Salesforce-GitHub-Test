  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Eliminates discrepancies in invoice totals.</li>
    <li>Improves customer trust and reduces support inquiries.</li>
    <li>Ensures compliance with financial reporting standards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Changes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented standardized rounding function across all calculation modules.</li>
    <li>Added unit tests for edge cases in tax and discount calculations.</li>
    <li>Updated documentation for financial calculation procedures.</li>
  </ul>
